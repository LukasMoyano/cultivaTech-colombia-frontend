# CultivoList Component Contrast Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the contrast and readability of text elements and placeholder images in the CultivoList.jsx component, particularly for night mode (Eva 001).

## Issues Identified
1. Text elements using `text-text-main/80` had insufficient contrast in night mode
2. Brown placeholder images (`#A77B55`) were difficult to see against the dark background in night mode
3. No visual distinction for placeholder images in night mode

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Text Contrast
Removed the 80% opacity from all text elements in the CultivoList component:
- Changed `text-text-main/80` to `text-text-main` for all text elements
- This ensures full opacity text which provides better readability in night mode

### 2. Enhanced Placeholder Images
Replaced the static placeholder image URL with a dynamic approach:
- For cultivos with images: Display the actual image
- For cultivos without images: Display a styled div with theme-appropriate colors
- Added the `cultivo-placeholder` CSS class for consistent styling

### 3. Night Mode Specific Styles
Added CSS rules that automatically adjust placeholder styling in night mode:
- Lighter brown background (`#C99D77`) for better visibility
- Dark text (`#1A1A1A`) for contrast against the lighter background
- Border using the theme's border color for better definition

## Files Modified

1. `/src/components/cultivos/CultivoList.jsx`:
   - Removed 80% opacity from all text elements
   - Replaced static placeholder image with dynamic component
   - Added `cultivo-placeholder` class to placeholder elements

2. `/src/index.css`:
   - Added `.cultivo-placeholder` styles
   - Added night mode specific styles for placeholder elements

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the application
2. Switch to night mode
3. Navigate to the "MIS CULTIVOS" page
4. Observe the improved contrast of:
   - All text elements in the cultivo cards
   - Placeholder images (should now be clearly visible)
   - Borders around placeholder images

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Night Mode)
- Text: Light gray with reduced opacity (hard to read)
- Placeholder images: Dark brown against near black background (difficult to see)
- No distinct border around placeholders

### After (Night Mode)
- Text: Pure white with full opacity (easy to read)
- Placeholder images: Light brown with dark text and visible border (clearly visible)
- Consistent styling with the overall theme

## Benefits
1. Significantly improved readability in night mode
2. Better visual hierarchy and consistency
3. Maintains the existing color scheme while improving contrast
4. Responsive to theme changes (automatically adjusts between day/night modes)
5. No impact on day mode appearance (maintains existing look)
