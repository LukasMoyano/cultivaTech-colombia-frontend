# AccesoRapidoPanel Cultivos Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem Description
The AccesoRapidoPanel component was failing to load cultivos data with a 403 Forbidden error when making requests to the `/api/cultivos` endpoint.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The API endpoint `/api/cultivos` requires authentication via JWT token
2. The 403 error indicates that either:
   - No token was provided
   - The token was invalid or expired
   - The user doesn't have permission to access cultivos
3. The original error handling was generic and didn't provide specific feedback to the user

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific error messages based on HTTP status codes:
  - 401: Token expired - prompts user to log in again
  - 403: Permission denied - indicates account verification issue
  - 500: Server error - suggests retrying later
  - Network errors: Connection issues - advises checking internet

### 2. Token Validation
- Added pre-request validation to check if a token exists
- Automatically clears expired tokens from localStorage when a 401 error occurs

### 3. Retry Mechanism
- Added a "Reintentar" (Retry) button that allows users to attempt reloading the data
- Implemented a dedicated fetch function that can be called both on component mount and retry

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- More descriptive error messages to guide users
- Clear call-to-action buttons for different scenarios
- Visual feedback during loading states

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/dashboard/AccesoRapidoPanel.jsx`: Complete rewrite of data fetching and error handling logic

## Testing Instructions
1. Ensure you're logged in with a valid account
2. Navigate to the dashboard to view the AccesoRapidoPanel
3. If you see a 401 error, try logging out and logging back in
4. If you see a 403 error, verify your account has the proper permissions
5. Use the "Reintentar" button to attempt reloading data after resolving issues

## Additional Notes
- The cultivos are user-specific, meaning each user can only see their own cultivos
- The cultivos are associated with users during registration
- If a user has no cultivos, they'll see a prompt to create their first one
